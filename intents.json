It has spacious rooms with windows opening into balcony, other facilities include common room and dining room, Apart from the infrastructural soundness, it provides sufficient scope for interaction and relationship-building. It provides a congenial atmosphere that gives the new students full scope to know their seniors, learn from them, leverage their knowledge and build lasting relations with them. It is also a common sight to find study groups and project groups working away into the night in the hostel rooms. These interactions play an especially important role in a studentâ€™s life during placements and examinations.
