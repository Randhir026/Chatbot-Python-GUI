# Chatbot-Python-GUI

The chatbot is an artificial intelligence-based conversational agent designed to interact with users through text input. Built using Python and various libraries such as TensorFlow, Flask, and Scikit-learn, this chatbot employs machine learning techniques to understand and respond to user queries or messages.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code sets up a Flask web application for a chatbot using a pre-trained model. It loads intents from a JSON file, tokenizes patterns with CountVectorizer, and defines routes for user input, predicting tags, and retrieving bot responses. The application runs on localhost when the script is executed.
