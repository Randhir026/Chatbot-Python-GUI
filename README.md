# Chatbot-Python-GUI
The code sets up a Flask web application for a chatbot using a pre-trained model. It loads intents from a JSON file, tokenizes patterns with CountVectorizer, and defines routes for user input, predicting tags, and retrieving bot responses. The application runs on localhost when the script is executed.
